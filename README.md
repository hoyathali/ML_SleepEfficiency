# Machine Learning Projects Repository

Welcome to my GitHub repository for storing and documenting my machine learning projects. This repository serves as a centralized location to showcase and organize the various projects I've undertaken in the field of machine learning. Each project is contained within its own directory, and this README provides an overview of the repository.


Each project directory contains subdirectories for code, data, and results, along with a dedicated README.md file providing details about the project.

## Projects

### 1.  Sleep Efficiency Prediction Project

- **Description:** This project focuses on predicting sleep efficiency using machine learning. Sleep efficiency is a critical metric for understanding the quality of sleep, and the goal of this project is to develop a model that can accurately predict sleep efficiency based on various demographic and lifestyle factors.
  
#### Running the Code

To run the code and reproduce the results:

1. Navigate to the project directory.
2. Execute the Jupyter notebook `Sleep_Efficency.ipynb`.
