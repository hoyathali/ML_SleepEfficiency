# Machine Learning Projects Repository

Welcome to my GitHub repository for storing and documenting my machine learning projects. This repository serves as a centralized location to showcase and organize the various projects I've undertaken in the field of machine learning. Each project is contained within its own directory, and this README provides an overview of the repository.


Each project directory contains subdirectories for code, data, and results, along with a dedicated README.md file providing details about the project.
